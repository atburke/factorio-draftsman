# factorio_version_testing.py

"""
Script that iterates over all the tagged versions of Factorio data and runs the
test suite to test exactly how far back Draftsman is compatable. Shows the 
errors that occured when the commands were run.

This tells us that Draftsman works well with any version of Factorio greater 
than 1.0.0; prior to this there are some structural changes that probably 
require a separate version. Since the likelyhood the people will be using 
versions of Factorio prior to 1.0.0 is quite slim, I feel comfortable kicking 
this can down the road.
